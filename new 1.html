<h4> Likely in the early 1970s </h4>

William Afton and Henry Emily meet and start working together. They develop designs for animatronic animals whose internals can be manipulated so that they can also be worn as mascot costumes by people. They open a restaurant called Fredbear’s Family Diner, and create two animatronics to use there: Fredbear, and Spring Bonnie.

<h4> Likely during 1983, but before FNAF 4 happens </h4>

By this time, the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza location has opened and operates simultaneously with Fredbear's, featuring 4 new characters: Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox.

At either of the restaurants (could've been either Freddy's or Fredbear's, we don't know 100%), William kills Henry’s daughter Charlie (Charlotte) outside the building. Henry had previously installed a Security Puppet at the restaurant to protect his daughter, and the Puppet goes outside the building and malfunctions because of the rain. To continue protecting her, The Puppet merges with Charlie’s spirit as she dies. Charlie's death does not prompt the closure of either restaurant.

<p> </p>

Note: This must take place before the death of William’s younger son, because when he comes home from killing Charlie, the younger brother is still alive, as Michael mentions him to his father, saying “he had a rough day”. (This would be the Midnight Motorist minigame). 

<p> </p>

<h4> During 1983 </h4>

Both Freddy's 1 and Fredbear's are still open.

Michael keeps scaring Evan with the Foxy mask that he owns, adding to Evan's fear of the animatronics/the restaurants, likely stemming from Charlie's death. William keeps talking to Evan through a Fredbear plushie with a walkie talkie in it, providing Evan a companion despite William's abuse.

<p> He's here, he's there </p>

<p> He's everywhere </p>

<p> Who you gonna call? </p>

<p> Psychic Friend Fredbear </p>

On Evan's birthday, Michael accidentally maims Evan by shoving him into the mouth of Fredbear. Evan's spirit bonds with Fredbear. Either Michael or Evan is haunted by spirits of the characters in the form of the Nightmare Animatronics, and Evan ultimately dies in the hospital, with Michael promising to Evan that he'll "put him back together", or otherwise save/avenge him. Phone Guy calls back to the Fnaf 1 location and informs them to stop using the springlock suits, and Fredbear's closes.

<p> </p>

Note: The only reason I said it might be Michael who is haunted by the Nightmare Animatronics is because someone mentioned in the comments that Michael draws the Nightmares in the Survival Logbook as being from a dream he had recently. I still think that FNAF 4 is played as the Crying Child because of the heavy focus on him throughout that game, but the commenter's point is valid.

<p> </p>

<h4> Probably During 1985 (Don't @ me on this it's not 100% confirmed but it's the best we've got) </h4>

The First Missing Children’s Incident happens at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza 1, the restaurant closes, William opens Circus Baby’s Pizza World, a young Elizabeth Afton dies by getting clawed by Baby, William places Baby underground in a facility that will later become Circus Baby’s Rentals from Sister Location, located under the Afton house. It's possible that the Funtime Animatronics were created around this point.

Several Potential Dates, Likely Happens Here, But Could Also Be After Fnaf 2

William tells Michael about Circus Baby’s Rentals, and that he can go there to find out about what happened to his sister.

<p> </p>

Sister Location takes place, and the Funtime Animatronics develop a consciousness and fuse into Ennard, with Baby/Elizabeth Afton leading them. They invade Michael’s body by using the Scooping Machine to remove his insides and take over by inserting themselves as his skeleton. At some point afterwards, they leave Michael’s body when he isn’t of any use to them anymore. Although it was unlikely, Michael survives, likely due to the Remnant present in his body (The games confirm Remnant is canon due to the Insanity Ending of Pizzeria Simulator). He promises to go and find his father to punish him for his crimes. (This is the quote/dialogue we hear after beating the Golden Freddy Challenge of Sister Location’s Custom Night).

<p> </p>

<h4> During 1987 </h4>

In the summer of this year, the second Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza location opens, this time with the new Toy Animatronics as an additional security measure against another MCI happening. William Afton is still around, serving in a Security Guard position. He’s ultimately fired some reason. (Phone Guy mentions the Day Shift position becoming “available” in FNAF 2). Shortly afterwards, Afton kills 5 more kids whose spirits go on to possess the Toy Animatronics, The Toy Animatronics become aggressive and start behaving oddly towards adults, especially those with a security guard uniform since it reminds them of their killer. Charlie’s spirit has awoken in the Puppet by now and gives gifts/life to the original 5 MCI kids by placing their spirits into Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Golden Freddy. During November of that year, Mangle becomes unstable and bites Jeremy Fitzgerald, the replacement Day Shift guard for William who was moved up after working the Night Shift. Fritz Smith replaces him for the final day, and the restaurant closes. The Toy Animatronics are scrapped, and the Classic Animatronics are retired back to the old location.

<p> </p>

Note: Fritz Smith may or may not be the Phone Guy, replacing Jeremy and taking over the position of night guard and carrying that over into Fnaf 1.

<p> </p>

<h4> During 1993 </h4>

The 3rd Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza location has been open for some time. Phone Guy is killed due to the animatronics still harboring anger towards people reminding them of their killer and Michael Afton starts working there as a Security Guard under the name Mike Schmidt, and the animatronics attack him due to thinking he’s William. He's fired at some point, likely due his condition after Sister Location. William is still around and eventually comes back to the restaurant to tear apart the original animatronics. The spirits of the original 5 rebel and trap him in the Spring Bonnie suit, but the spring locks fail and he’s sealed in the Safe Room. Due to the Remnant that’s present, he doesn’t die, and becomes Springtrap. The Puppet pacifies/brings peace to the original 5 spirits.

<p> </p> 

<h4> During 2023 </h4>

A new horror attraction/haunted house called Fazbear’s Fright is opening, to pay homage to/scare people based on the old urban legends/rumors about Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Michael Afton starts working there because he might get to see his father and end it all. The staff running the place unearth Springtrap and set him loose in the attraction. Michael attempts to hold off his father until he can burn down the building, but the fire fails to kill William.

<p> </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;"> <strong> Dates Unconfirmed From This Point On </strong></h3>

<p> </p>

<h4> Pizzeria Simulator </h4>

Henry has been in the background this whole time and sees Michael’s actions, deciding to finally end everything. He begins luring the remaining players to the final location, and gets Michael there as well. He builds Lefty to contain and capture the Puppet, and Baby gets kicked out of Ennard, who turns into Molten Freddy. Pizzeria Simulator takes place, and Henry burns the place down to finish everyone off one last time. However, he's only partially successful, as William survives somehow, perhaps due to connecting to other equipment/objects present? (Maybe some of the tech that led to the Help Wanted releasing him?) Henry, Charlie Emily, Elizabeth Afton, and possibly Michael Afton (As some current theories suggest, Glamrock Freddy could be Michael) all finally die.

<h4> Ultimate Custom Night </h4>

Cassidy, the spirit of Golden Freddy killed during the first MCI, despite seeing everyone else pass on including Michael Afton’s younger brother (potentially not, he may be Gregory in Security Breach), still holds a grudge against William Afton for his crimes. She creates UCN to torture William's spirit for all eternity, despite being told by Old Man Consequences, a friendly spirit, to let the past go and find peace.

<h4> Help Wanted </h4>

The company that becomes known as Fazbear Entertainment is now free of the people who originally corrupted Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza and everything that happened, so in order to maintain a good image, they hire an indie game developer to create video games based on the previous events, which may or may not be the actual games we’ve been playing (It's a huge stretch to say that they are, but they still might be although there’s no real evidence either way), and during that process, the game Five Nights at Freddy’s Help Wanted VR is being made by people working at the company. Part of William Afton's soul makes it into the game from some old hardware that the developers used to construct the game, and he becomes Glitchtrap, a code-based entity, and is trapped in the game. An employee working at the company discovers Glitchtrap's presence through both her own experiences and her observations of a coworker of hers, named Jeremy, being influenced and possibly controlled by Glitchtrap.

<p> </p>

She creates audio logs in the form of tapes in order to document it all, but Glitchtrap gains control of the tapes and begins using them as a means to escape back into the real world. She attempts to destroy him by separating the tapes, but Glitchtrap corrupts the tapes and stops her. William gets released back into the real world when he tricks the player character of Help Wanted (most likely an unnamed tester/worker at the company, may or may not be Tape Girl or Vanessa).

<h4> Special Delivery </h4>

In this fictional universe, technology has developed faster than in the real world, likely due to Fazbear Entertainment developing new things to expand their brand. Fazbear Entertainment develops an animatronic delivery service where people can buy samples for entertainment purposes. A virus appears and some part of William's essence/soul somehow makes it into the service despite not being intended to, and people start being attacked by animatronics from within the service.

<h4> Security Breach </h4>

Fazbear Entertainment has created a new attraction: Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex, featuring the new Glamrock Animatronics, confirmed to be built on top of the ruins of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place (the location of Pizzeria Simulator having its name retroactively revealed to us). William brainwashes a woman named Vanessa, a Fazbear Entertainment employee who recently worked for another part of the company but was recently hired at the Pizzaplex as the night security guard. She isn't willingly going along with his commands; she doesn't really want to be a killer but is being controlled anyways. Evidence from the game suggests she has been controlled for some time and has had many issues earlier in her life, as well as her change of position being sudden, unexpected, and ordered by someone with a lot of influence in the company.

<p> </p>

At some point, a child named Gregory gets trapped in the facility overnight while being hunted by Vanny, the white rabbit persona/costume that Vanessa built and used while being influenced by William. Gregory has to avoid/escape her while completing various tasks/interacting with animatronics around the facility. He eventually manages to damage but not disable the other 3 animatronics and escapes with Glamrock Freddy in various states of repair based on the ending. It's currently unconfirmed what the actual canon ending is, so all of them could be true, or none of them, although the ending where Vanessa is freed from William's control and she, Gregory, and a consisting-only-of-a-still-working-head Glamrock Freddy escape, with Vanessa possibly taking care of Gregory afterwards.

<p> </p> 

William is back in his physical form in the ever-decaying Springtrap suit, commonly labeled Burntrap for this iteration. During some of the possible events of the game, Glamrock Freddy and Gregory confront and stop him, with the Blob, a mangled mesh of previous characters/endoskeletons (probably with some Remnant in there too), dragging William back into the depths of the old Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place to attack/torture/destroy him.

<p> </p>

Some current theories point out that Gregory is somehow off or weird compared to regular people, and that the bond between Glamrock Freddy and Gregory may be evidence of a connection, even possibly that they might be embodiments/reincarnations or something similar of Michael and Evan Afton, respectively. (Evan isn't entirely confirmed but it's likely his name). Personally, I'm inclined to believe this.
